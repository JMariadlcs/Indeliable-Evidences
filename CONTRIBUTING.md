Contributing
----------------------------------

1. File an issue to notify the maintainers about what you're working on.
2. Fork the reposotory, develop and test your changes in the code.
3. Add docs.
3. Make sure that your commit messages clearly describe the changes.
4. Send a pull request.

File an Issue
----------------------------------

Use the issue tracker to start the discussion about your contribution in order to avoid situations in which someone else is aloready working on your idea or the functionality exists already. The ticket you file in the issue tracker will
be used to clear this out.

Style Guides
-------------------

- User modular architecture to group similar functions, classes, etc.
- Class names should always be lowercase
- Function names should always be lowercase
- Look at the existing style and adhere accordingly

Fork the Repository
-------------------

Be sure to add the relevant tests before making the pull request. Docs will be
updated automatically, docs should be made by yourself and make sure they describe the implemented functionally clearly.

Make the Pull Request
---------------------

Once you have made all your changes, tests, and updated the documentation,
make a pull request to move everything back into the main branch of the
`repository`. Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request.
